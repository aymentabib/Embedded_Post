# ss command hidden power 
## introduction: 
- I do this exploration when checking mosquitto broker.
- i want to know the amount of data sent and receveid by every tcp connection. 
- you can get this information but with iftop command using show total  option, but you start counting from the 
  the isntant of command execution not from the begining of tcp connection.
