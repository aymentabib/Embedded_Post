a post related to git in the tunisan university :
- in this days, git is not only a tools for software engeenieer.
- git and others vcs are integrated to many ECAD like ALtium and kicad :
 - https://cadlab.io/git-version-control-for/kicad 
 - https://www.altium.com/documentation/altium-designer/using-version-control?version=21
- you need version control for every project.
- other project example that we can use git to track changes. 
- it's inacceptable today, in STEM eduction without knowing using git basis.

-  and here, I talk about public university, not pirvate ones.
- to be constructive here the tutoriel taht I recomand : 
 -  the first section"Learn git" it's related only to bitbucket cloud. for a beginner you must start by the second section : 
 "beginner"
