When i ask studend or intern about TLS protocol of they know how basically it works  they answer me yes and there is a hand shake a key exchange and other steps in the tls. But when I start asking some why questions there no answers? When i started working with TLS, i had some why questions rises in my head.  An expert in cybersecurity should knows the answers but not me at this time ? The answers didnt change how you you use the tls or improve the security but  at least you understand the logic behind those steps.

If we know how it works we should know why.

Great question! Instead of using **public-private key encryption** for all communication, TLS uses a **session key** (symmetric encryption) after the handshake. Here‚Äôs why:

Great question! In AWS IoT Core and TLS (Transport Layer Security) in general, these three files serve distinct roles in establishing a secure communication channel between your IoT device and AWS IoT Core.

### **1. Server Certificate (CA) - `root CA.pem`**
   - **Purpose:** This is the **Root Certificate Authority (CA)** that verifies AWS IoT Core's identity.
   - **When it‚Äôs used:** When your IoT device connects to AWS IoT Core, it needs to verify that it is talking to the genuine AWS IoT Core service and not an impostor. The Root CA certificate is used to validate the server's identity by checking that AWS IoT Core‚Äôs certificate is signed by a trusted authority (Amazon Trust Services or other recognized CAs).
   - **How it works:** The device checks if the AWS IoT Core certificate was issued by this trusted CA before proceeding with the connection.

---

### **2. Client Certificate - `cert.crt`**
   - **Purpose:** This is the certificate that **identifies your IoT device** to AWS IoT Core.
   - **When it‚Äôs used:** When your device initiates a TLS connection, AWS IoT Core requests proof of the device‚Äôs identity. The client certificate is sent to AWS IoT Core during the handshake to authenticate the device.
   - **How it works:** AWS IoT Core verifies this certificate against its own records to confirm that this device is allowed to connect.

---

### **3. Client Private Key - `private.key`**
   - **Purpose:** This **proves ownership** of the client certificate and is used to encrypt/sign messages.
   - **When it‚Äôs used:** During the TLS handshake, the device needs to prove that it actually possesses the corresponding private key for the client certificate. This is done by signing a challenge issued by AWS IoT Core.
   - **How it works:** The private key is never sent over the network. Instead, it‚Äôs used to sign data that AWS IoT Core can verify using the public key from the client certificate.

---

### **How They Work Together in TLS**
1. **Device Verifies AWS IoT Core** ‚Üí The IoT device checks the **Root CA certificate** (`root CA.pem`) to confirm AWS IoT Core is legitimate.
2. **AWS IoT Core Verifies Device** ‚Üí The device sends its **client certificate** (`cert.crt`) to AWS IoT Core.
3. **Device Proves Identity** ‚Üí The device uses its **private key** (`private.key`) to sign a challenge from AWS IoT Core, proving it owns the certificate.
4. **Secure Communication Established** ‚Üí Both sides agree on encryption keys, and encrypted communication begins.

### **üîë Why Not Use Public-Key Encryption for All Communication?**  
1Ô∏è‚É£ **Performance (Speed & Efficiency)**
   - **Public-key (Asymmetric) encryption** (e.g., RSA, ECC) is **slow** because it involves complex mathematical operations.
   - **Session keys (Symmetric encryption)** (e.g., AES) are much **faster** because they use simple mathematical operations optimized for hardware acceleration.
   - Encrypting every message with RSA or ECC would **drastically slow down communication**, especially for IoT devices with limited processing power.

2Ô∏è‚É£ **Resource Constraints in IoT Devices**
   - Many IoT devices have limited CPU, memory, and power.
   - Public-key cryptography requires **expensive computations**, which can drain battery life and slow down data processing.
   - Symmetric encryption (AES) is lightweight and can run efficiently even on small microcontrollers.

3Ô∏è‚É£ **Key Size & Bandwidth Efficiency**
   - Public-key encryption (RSA 2048-bit, ECC) requires **large key sizes** for security.
   - Symmetric encryption (AES-256) requires much **smaller keys**, reducing bandwidth usage.
   - A **single symmetric session key** is enough for both sides to encrypt and decrypt messages efficiently.

4Ô∏è‚É£ **Forward Secrecy & Security**
   - If an attacker captures past encrypted data, they could **decrypt it later** if they obtain the private key.
   - With session keys, even if one session key is compromised, it only affects **that session**, not previous or future ones.
   - Many TLS implementations use **Ephemeral Diffie-Hellman (ECDHE)** to generate a unique session key for every new connection, preventing long-term key exposure.

---

### **üîê How TLS Solves This?**
- The public key is only used for **authentication** and securely exchanging a one-time **session key**.
- Once both parties **agree on a session key**, they switch to **fast symmetric encryption** (AES, ChaCha20).
- This gives us the **best of both worlds**:  
  ‚úÖ **Public-key cryptography for security** (handshake & authentication).  
  ‚úÖ **Symmetric encryption for speed** (actual data transmission).

---

### **üöÄ Example: Real-World Comparison**
Imagine you want to securely send a large file (1GB) over the internet:  
- **Public-key encryption for the whole file?** ‚ùå Takes too long (inefficient).  
- **Use public-key encryption to exchange a small key, then use symmetric encryption?** ‚úÖ Much faster!

---

### **üìù Summary**
| Encryption Type | Used For | Pros | Cons |
|---------------|---------|------|------|
| **Public-Key (Asymmetric)** (RSA, ECC) | Authentication & Key Exchange | Secure, No pre-shared keys needed | Slow, High CPU usage |
| **Session Key (Symmetric)** (AES, ChaCha20) | Encrypting Data | Fast, Low CPU usage | Needs a secure way to exchange the key |

This is why TLS **only uses public-key cryptography at the start** and switches to **session keys** for actual data transfer. üöÄ
